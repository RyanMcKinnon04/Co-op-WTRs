            <p>
                As mentioned, Loblaw Companies Limited is one of the largest companies in Canada. It was a great
                opportunity to get to experience what working at a giant like Loblaw would be like. The company's main
                headquarters that I worked at was in Brampton. Inside was a massive atrium with a cafeteria, providing
                easy access to full meals for lunch each day, which was a particular highlight of working there. Loblaw
                hires numerous co-op students each term. There were actually two other co-op students along with me on
                the Replenishment Optimization team. It was fun to exchange experiences and work together through
                various tasks throughout the term.
                <br><br>
                The main job of the Replenishment Optimization team that I was a part of is to aid the Replenishment
                team in
                their duties. Replenishment means maintaining item availability in stores. It aims to keep a constant
                flow of item availability. One of our team's central responsibilities is an analytics dashboard that
                displays a
                wide vareity of different metrics and statistics to aid in decision-making. This dashboard is made using
                PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and was a primary focal point of my work throughout my term.

                            My first major task during my term was to work on enhancements for the SDM Planogram page in
                            the Replenishment Optimization Dashboard. A planogram is a large table containing data for
                            each item in a particular category. Various teams use planograms to determine when items are
                            projected to run out of stock. The page itself was still a work in progress and
                            had not yet launched to be viewed by the company. The previous co-op student in my position
                            ended their term working on it. It was my job to pick up where they left off.
                            <br><br>
                            I first had to
                            finish a Pyhton script that they were working on that was used to pull data from a number of
                            different places to get everything that was needed for the planogram. This script used
                            multiple libraries that I had not worked with before, including Pandas and Win32. This was a
                            great opportunity to familioarize myself with new capabilities in Python.
                            After completing
                            the Python script, I had to work with SQL in Teradata to grab and add data to the backend
                            database that was used for the Planogram. Before this position, my knowledge of SQL was very
                            surface level. However, because of all the SQL work I got to do, I learned a lot about how
                            queries can be nested and joined onto one another to form very large expressions.
                            And finally, the last aspect of the Planogram that I enhanced was the dashboard page itself.
                            I made a lot of little imporvements, like adding extra filter options, extra table columns,
                            and a popup that informs the user of the most recent additions to the Planogram. Since the
                            dashboard was made using PHP, I got to learn a whole new programming language by working on
                            it!
                            <br><br>
                            Soon after all my enhancements were made, the page officially launched, which was a pretty
                            cool feeling seeing others use the things that I created. Working on this Planogram page
                            served as a great introduction to what sorts of things I'd be working on and taught me a lot
                            of new technologies as well.

                            Another ongoing part of my job at Loblaw was creating numerous scripts to automate
                            manual tasks. Most of these tasks had to do with exporting data from various places.
                            <br><br>
                            For one task, I learned a new Python library called Selenium, which lets me pre-program an
                            order of
                            actions to take in a web browser such as Chrome to navigate a website. The primary actions
                            that I was able to automate were logging into the website, clicking buttons, and filling out
                            text boxes. This was a really
                            cool new library to learn and taught me a lot about making programs to interact with
                            external applications.
                            <br><br>
                            Another automation task I had was to export a large amount of data from the company's SAP
                            system. To do this, I used SAP's scirpt recording feature to write part of a VBA script to
                            automate SAP's navigation. I then made additions the the script and embedded it into an
                            Excel file. I did this so that the VBA script could then pull data filters from the Excel
                            document to then be put into SAP to cut down the export time dramatically. This opened my
                            eyes to combining multiple technologies together to achieve a better result,
                            and also taught me a new thing that I can do with Excel.
                            <br><br>
                            And finally, another major automation script I wrote was for creating an excel file and an
                            email notification system. The Replenishment Optimization team that I was a part of had 7
                            virtual computers that they use to schedule all of their automation scripts. The Excel file
                            I was making was to document every task that was scheduled so that the team can easily keep
                            track of which script is scheduled on which computer. Each of the computers had a script
                            scheduled to pull all the task scheduler information
                            into
                            their own separate excel files. It was then my script's job to read each one and combine
                            them into one large file. Not only that, but my script also had to send emails on Outlook to
                            the team notifying them of any changes to the schedules since the last file update. Writing
                            this script gave me a great opportunity to learn Python libraries that allowed
                            me to manipulate Excel documents directly and also send emails via Outlook. For Excel, I
                            learned about the library called OpenPyXL, which lets me read and write data to and from
                            excel files. And for Outlook I learned about the os library, which essentially allows you to
                            interact with a vast array of applications of your computer like the operating system would.
                            I used this to open and send emails through outlook.
                            <br><br>
                            Making these smaller Python scripts broadened my persepctive on what programming can be used
                            for. Up until this point, I had only made programs that have some form of user interaction.
                            Making programs for the purpose of being run on a schedule with no intervention was a pretty
                            cool new perspective on programmiing that I hadn't thought of before. I also learned many
                            new technologies that I'm sure can be applied in many future programs that I write.

                            My third and final major task during my work term served as a culmination of my learning and
                            experiences that I wrote about earlier. Once again involving the Replenishment Optimization
                            dashbaord, instead of having to add onto an existing page, I was tasked with creating a
                            brand new one from scratch! The purpose of this page is to display metrics to do with item
                            availability for items that were a part of Loblaw's holiday promotions, called the Holiday
                            Insider's Report. The availability calculation looks at, out of all of Loblaw's stores, how
                            many have the item in stock, and how many are out of stock.
                            <br><br>
                            Making this page entirely on my own was a really cool way to demonstrate all that I learned.
                            Not only did I have to use PHP to make the actual page, I also created a brand new SQL table
                            to house the information needed for the availability calculation. And because this table
                            needed to have the most up to date information, I had to create a script that would query
                            the
                            relevant information and insert it into the table. Additionally, there was an additional
                            request to be able to see the availability metrics at various levels of detail, for example
                            a regional perspective all the way down to individual items. Because of this, I made 5
                            different table views, each with a different level of scrutiny. And futhermore, because
                            Loblaw's acquisition of Shoppwer's Drug Mart was still recent, some of its data remains
                            separate from the rest of the Loblaw companies. Thus, I actually ended up making 10
                            different table views, 5 for Loblaw and 5 for Shopper's Drug Mart.

                        <p>
                            My first goal for this term had to do with working independently:<br>
                            I wanted to make an effort to be less reliant on my supervisor/coworkers when solving
                            problems. I wanted to be able to come up with
                            solutions to problems that are entirely my own without always feeling the need to reach out
                            to my supervisor for
                            guidance.
                            <br><br>
                            I believe that I did a great job achieving this goal. Right away it became apparent to me
                            that Loblaw worked with a lot more raw programming than Slalom did. Within my first week, I
                            was given a large python script that I had to continue the development of. Not that I wasn't
                            given any help, but it was largely up to me to determine how it works and how I could add to
                            it. Instead of bothering my manager with questions that I could easily answer myself, I did
                            a lot of research and testing of the program and all its components on my own. After doing
                            this for a day, I was able to achieve <img class="imageR app3"
                                src="Loblaw/Independent Work.png" alt="Independent Work">a sound understanding of every
                            part of the script
                            that, at the beginning, looked very daunting. Being able to work independently like this
                            left my manager very impressed, and I was very glad to have largely figured it out on my
                            own.
                            <br><br>
                            My manager was actually very helpful in my desire to reach this goal. He made an effort to
                            leave the projects he gave up to my opinion of how I wanted to tackle them. Beyond giving a
                            few suggestions when assigning a task, he trusted me to determine my own method of
                            completing them. This gave me a lot of freedom for critical thinking to tackle these
                            problems, which was a huge help in achieving this goal.

                            My next goal is about learning achieving a strong understanding of the things that I
                            learn:<br>
                            It's somewhat similar to a goal I had last term. When learning new things to do with
                            technology or the business, I want to
                            ensure I learn more than just the bare minimum. I want to push myself to delve deeper into
                            the things that I learn so
                            that I will be competent enough with these things that I can apply them again in different
                            contexts and scenarios.
                            <br><br>
                            While I did have some success with this goal, I think I could have gone further with it.
                            Through my 4 months working at Loblaw, I was introduced to a lot of new software, like
                            Pandas, Selenium, PHP, and Teradata. I did learn a lot about these softwares, but I wouldn't
                            call myself an expert in any of them. When working with them in the future, I will
                            definitely need to look up how to do certain things with them instead of being able to just
                            do it. I acknowledge that looking up code solutions is a skill in it of itself, but I would
                            love to be less reliant on looking things up in the future. This will likely be an ongoing
                            goal of mine
                            in my future work terms to try and achieve.
                            <br><br>
                            <img class="joinapp app1" src="Loblaw/Pandas.jpeg" alt="Pandas">

                            <br><br>
                            That isn't to say that I retained nothing from all that I learned. I am definitely more
                            capable in these technologies than I was before the work term. And even if I may not know
                            everything about them, when thinking of solutions to future problems, it is extremely
                            beneficial to have these technologies in my repertoire so that I have more potential
                            solutions to choose from.

                            My final goal for this term is a continuation of the one that I had last term to do with
                            asking questions:<br>
                            While I made great progress on it last term, I still believe I can further improve at asking
                            questions without fear of appearing
                            inadequate. However, at the same time, I don't want to ask questions too frequently when the
                            answer is readily attainable by myself, relating to goal #1.
                            <br>
                            <img class="imageR app3" src="Loblaw/Questions.jpg" alt="Independent Work">
                            <br>
                            I am happy to say
                            that I did very well at achieving this goal. As mentioned in my reflection
                            for goal #1, I made a large effort to do everything I could to answer the question myself
                            before asking my manager. And because of that, I can't recall a single time where fear of
                            judgement
                            stopped me from asking a question. I had a great understanding of what questions
                            were solvable, and which ones were worth asking. My manager was very helpful with this as
                            well. They never hesitated to answer any question I had. In fact, he scheduled a meeting
                            with me every morning to check in, see how things were going and if I had any questions. He
                            made it very easy to inquire about any struggles or roadblocks I was hitting.

                            All-in-all, my co-op expoerience at Loblaw Companies Limited was a positive one. I got a
                            taste for working at a very large company, had lots of opportunities to learn new things and
                            develop my goals, and I had a great manager who was always happy to help. I will definitely
                            be taking all that I've learned and putting them forward into my future career pursuits. Not
                            only did I develop my ability to know when to ask questions and how to pursue answers on my
                            own, but I also learned numerous new software technologies that are widely used in many
                            places today. I am very grateful for the opportunity that Loblaw gave me this term, and look
                            forward to seeing where my co-op journey takes me next.
