                As mentioned, Slalom makes an effort to be as human as possible when working with clients. Not only with
                clients, but with each other as well. The people at Slalom consistently push their 10 core values and
                follow them each and every day. Throughout my time here, I was never afraid of asking "dumb" questions
                and was always encouraged to speak up if I wasn't understanding something. Slalom curates a very
                learning-oriented work model, always encouraging its employees to be curious and try new things.
                <br><br>
                Slalom is also closely partnered with some of the biggest technology companies of the world today,
                including
                Microsoft, AWS, Google, and Salesforce. This contributes to Slalom's technological branch significantly.
                Salesforce and Microsoft products are used on a day-to-day basis and are central to the
                business operations and communication within the company. Slalom consistently strives for innovation in
                the technology space. They have dove head first into creating AI products to aid with internal tasks, as
                well as with client solutions. Slalom also creates many unique, in-house applications to be able to have
                the tools that are tailored specifically to their needs.

                            My primary role throughout my internship at Slalom was working closley with their
                            company-wide data.
                            As part of this, I got to learn Salesforce and Power BI at a deep level, becoming very
                            profficient at them by the end.
                            <br><br>In Salesforce, I made numerous reports and dashboards ranging
                            from financial data to information about campaigns, opportunities, and individual clients.
                            Salesforce is rooted in Slalom's day to day operations, and as such, was in mine as well. I
                            also used Salesforce to be able to track how various things such as client engagements and
                            campaigns are doing.
                            <br><br>In
                            Power BI, I worked closely with one of the leaders of Slalom's Montreal
                            market. We had a near daily back and forth throughout the creation process and refinement of
                            a Power BI dashboard. This dashboard consisted of numerous different visuals, such as
                            tables, matrices, bar graphs, line graphs, and circle graphs, overviewing the entire
                            business' earned and forecasted revenue, as well as the revenue goals. Upon completion, this
                            dashboard got shared amongst numerous Slalom coworkers, serving as a useful visual tool for
                            decision-making and understanding the current state of the business. Working on this
                            dashboard, I learned a lot about the intricicies of Power BI, including managing inter-table
                            relationships, creating custom measures, and linking multiple datapoints together. Not only
                            that, but working on this dashboard truly felt impactful for the company. The dashboard I
                            made may very well become one of the company's core dashboards used by a lot of people.

                            R4 is Slalom's largest annual event that they hold. It is an event that intends to bring
                            together the leaders of all of Slalom's clients in hopes of building relationships and new
                            connections amongst each other. Each year also gets their set of guest speakers from a wide
                            variety of industries, such as sports, movies, and other public figures. Their most
                            well-known speaker was Michelle Obama last year! The speaker list for this year is featured
                            below.
                            <br><br>I worked pretty closely with the invite process for the R4 event. Many leaders
                            across
                            the country were responsible for identifying various contacts that they wanted to invite to
                            the event, and I shared some repsponsibility in ensuring data correctness of these contacts.
                            Salesforce data of these contacts gets pulled into automated email invites once a week. Each
                            time those data pulls came around, I was tasked with reaching out to each contact's related
                            Slalom leader to ensure data correctness. I was also able to answer many questions these
                            leaders had about the invite process was. It was great being able to work so closely
                            with them, and I greatly improved my communication skills in doing so!

                            The last major ongoing responsibility I had during my internship at Slalom was Exception
                            Reporting for the company's opportunities entered in Salesforce. Opportunities are Slalom's
                            potential projects and
                            contracts with clients. Exception reporting consists of identifying various
                            data-related problems with these opportunities. Some examples of problems were dates that
                            were no longer the actual target date, staffing plans that were not fully updates, or some
                            opportunities just no longer being relevant. It was my job to go in and investigate any
                            opportunities that were flagged with potential problems and communicate these problems to
                            the opportunities' corresponding coordinator. Doing so helped me a lot with my communication
                            skills since I reached out about these opportunity exceptions a few times every week. I had
                            to
                            articulate the problem to my coworkers who may not have been as well versed in Salesforce,
                            as well as suggest logical solutions to these exceptions.

                            My goal was to develop my skills in self-scheduling my various tasks within a professional
                            environment, consisting of tasks of varying priority, as well as group tasks.
                            <br><br>While I already had good time management skills in a school
                            setting, learning to
                            schedule
                            each day in a work environment
                            proved to be a different experience. There were numerous times at Slalom where I had
                            multiple tasks on the go at once.
                            Because of this, I was able to work on integrating task prioritization into my time
                            management skill set. The factors I
                            analyzed to be able to prioritize my tasks were how quick the task needed to be completed,
                            how long it would likely take
                            to complete, and if I had any other meetings/commitments in the coming days. By putting all
                            of this together, I
                            developed a solid strategy to ensure I complete all my tasks on time.

                            lot of their work would
                            fall onto my shoulders, including others coming to me asking for technological guidance as
                            well as having to reach out to my
                            coworkers regarding invites for the R4 event. There came a point in the week where I had
                            about 5 different things going
                            on at once, which did become overwhelming at first. But, because of the organizational
                            skills I picked up throughout my
                            work term, I was able to rise to the challenge and successfully complete every task that
                            came my way. This was a
                            defining moment that proved to me that I had achieved my goal in further developing my
                            time-management skills and my
                            ability to apply them in a work setting.

                            My next goal was all about Technological Literacy:<br>
                            The goal was to improve my knowledge, understanding, and proficiency in new and familiar
                            modern-day technologies in hopes of being
                            brought with me into my future career endeavours.
                            <br><br>Going into this internship, which was very data-oriented, the only database
                            technology I was familiar with was SQL.
                            Right away, on my first day of work, I was introduced to Slalom’s primary data tools that
                            were used on a daily basis;
                            Salesforce and Power BI. I had barely heard of either of these, but was very eager to learn
                            them, and my supervisor was
                            very eager to teach me as well! This made for a very enjoyable work environment where I was
                            never afraid to ask
                            questions.
                            <br><br><img class="imageR app2" src="Salesforce.png" alt="Saleforce">I began working
                            primarily in Salesforce, learning about its major attributes,
                            including Reports, Campaigns,
                            Dashboards, and Engagements. Salesforce is very central to Slalom’s day-to-day work with
                            their clients, which enabled me
                            to learn how to create reports from multiple sources, as well as transforming them into
                            visually appealing dashboards.
                            From starting off not even hearing about Salesforce, I became pretty proficient and able to
                            navigate my way around. So
                            much so that I was actually able to obtain a certification as a Salesforce Associate thanks
                            to all that I learned.
                            <br><br>Additionally, after some time
                            into my internship, I started a pretty big project for
                            one of
                            Slalom’s leaders in
                            <img class="imageR app2" src="Excel.png" alt="Excel">
                            Montreal. I was tasked with sprucing up a financial Excel file of his to go from being
                            exclusively
                            for Montreal to being for all
                            of Canada. It was here that I learned a lot of new aspects of Excel that I had never worked
                            with before, including Pivot
                            Tables, conditional formatting, and using External Data Connections. This expanded my
                            knowledge of the
                            possibilities of what Excel could
                            be used for. Pivot Tables can allow for Excel documents to be a lot more dynamic,
                            interactive, and customizable. And
                            creating External Data Connections to Salesforce and Power BI increases the reporting
                            potential of Excel and reduces
                            a lot of manual data entry.
                            <br><br><img class="imageR app2" src="PowerBI.png" alt="Power BI">Finally, after translating
                            the Montreal file to work for all of
                            Canada, I was then tasked to
                            translate that Excel file into Power BI to make it much more visually appealing and
                            comprehensive. This provided me with
                            a vast amount of time to play around and learn a lot of the intricacies of Power BI. I
                            learned a lot about creating
                            custom measures, creating Foreign Key relationships between tables, combining multiple
                            datasets together, and creating
                            concise visuals. After working on the Power BI dashboard as my primary ongoing project
                            of my
                            internship, I became extremely proficient and comfortable in Power BI.
                            <br><br>In conclusion, I
                            would say that I met this goal
                            in a big way. Not only did I learn new features of Excel, a tool that I was already familiar
                            with, but I was also
                            introduced to and became very proficient in two brand new technologies, being Salesforce and
                            Power BI. I will definitely
                            be able to use the knowledge that I have gained in my future career endeavours.

                            My third and final goal of this work term had to do with Inquiry & Analysis:
                            My goal was to learn and practice my ability to listen to both coworkers as well as external
                            clients and pose questions to ensure I
                            understand what they are asking. I want to not be afraid of how my questions may be
                            perceived upon asking them. If I do not understand something and
                            need further clarification, I strive to be able to simply ask the question and seek the
                            guidance I need. However, at the
                            same time, I want to ensure I do my best to gather any information I can about the topic
                            prior to inquiring about it, so
                            that I only pose meaningful questions instead of ones where the answer can be found easily.
                            <br><br>While I definitely think I made some progress on this goal throughout my work term,
                            I
                            still have
                            work to do. Asking
                            questions when I wasn’t understanding something was constantly in my thoughts during every
                            meeting I was a part of. I
                            made sure to go outside my comfort zone and pose meaningful questions as I felt were needed.
                            I also made a strong effort
                            to take notes during my conversations with my coworkers to help retain and further
                            understand what is being asked of me. Even still, despite my best efforts, there were times
                            where I shied away from asking
                            questions out of the worry of
                            appearing inadequate. This occasionally caused a slowdown of progress on my tasks, as I had
                            to spend a while trying to
                            figure out what exactly I was supposed to do.
                            <br><br><img class="imageL app3" src="Questions.jpg" alt="Asking Questions">Overall,
                            Slalom’s growth-oriented
                            environment made for a great
                            place to help me develop this goal. I was often encouraged by my supervisor as well as my
                            other coworkers to speak up if
                            I wasn’t following, which helped to make me feel more comfortable to do so. It was also
                            helpful to learn from their
                            example and see them pose meaningful questions without a second thought. The same goes for
                            note-taking as well. My
                            supervisor constantly makes notes during meetings to help herself stay on top of everything
                            that’s asked of her. Seeing
                            this strategy in action inspired me to do the same. Although I was far from perfect when it
                            came to these things, not
                            all goals can be expected to be achieved in one work term, and I still made a lot of
                            important steps in the right
                            direction even if I’m not fully there yet.

                            Overall, my time at Slalom Consulting was incredibly valuble as my first Co-op Work Term.
                            With an exceptionally kind-hearted and growth-oriented work environment, I was given
                            numerous
                            opportunities to grow and progress myself in my career. Through working closely with
                            company-wide data anlytics, I became proficient in two brand-new technologies. Additionally,
                            when ensuring data-cleanliness for Slalom's R4 event, as well as their many consulting
                            opportunities, I
                            got to work on and improve my communication skills by reaching out to coworkers on the
                            daily. My first work term at Slalom was very growth-oriented and I very much look
                            forward to continuing that growth in my future work terms.
